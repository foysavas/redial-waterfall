# redial-waterfall

Alternative `waterfall` trigger for `redial` that chains redial hooks down the component line.

Lifted directly from [meriadec](https://github.com/meriadec)'s [pull request](https://github.com/markdalgleish/redial/pull/32). Hopefully, that pull request gets merged into redial, so that I can destroy this package.
